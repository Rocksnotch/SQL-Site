                <h1> Why Solar? </h1>
                <p> Solar is the future! Anything you take outside that can use electricity SHOULD use solar. We intend to fully revolutionize the field of outside electronic usage with solar power. It's a technology you can just chuck onto other things, what is there NOT to love about it? Solar is a poorly-used technology in our everyday world, and here at the Solar Division, we strive to increase solar usage by over 1000%*!</p>
